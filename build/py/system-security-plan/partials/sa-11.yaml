            Developers have developed and implemented a plan for ongoing security and privacy control assessments; perform unit, integration, system, and regression testing/evaluation weekly at full depth and coverage; produce evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of the testing and evaluation; implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and correct flaws identified during testing and evaluation.
